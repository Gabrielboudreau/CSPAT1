### How did you know you wanted to do Comp Sci

- Compare and contrast with other positions, talent in CS.

- Problem solving.

- Passion for CS, enjoyed problem solving.

- Not passionate but understood importance, internships involved scripting.

- Importance of user design and CSP for technical background. 

- Always interested in CS. APCSA showed how to use through application. COVID-19 Database.

### What is the biggest CS challenge

- Keeping motivation in spite of difficulty and errors.

- Egos, focus on your own path and progress, follow your own curves. 

- Theory behind CS and complications that you didn't realize before. Highschool to College transition.

- Motivation in CS, feeling worse. Project in mind helped with keeping focus and learning. 

- Starting, temptation to BS, take the easy yet worse route and try to cut corners (above and beyond).

- Structure and order can be very confusing and it's hard to get started. Don't be afraid to diverge from the plan.

### Are there PBL scenarios in college

- Yes, 2 hands on projects done in college. Very theory based, still does exist though. 

- Mix of PBL and exams. Sometimes can be split.

- Teacher can't focus on individual, group learning. 

### Have you applied CS in a major not thats not CS

- Conversions can be automated. 

- Programs can be used to rework projects, 3d printing?

- Problem solving logic, not just CS but key concepts outside of actual work.

- Math library can do work for you.

- Jupyter notebooks used for technical papers to make them interactive.

- Programming involved in stats.

### Have you had a job before implemented with school or your professor

- Apply and create a resume that makes you memorable. Show you're different.

- Kind's of jobs or internship: TA's, bus driver (lol), code ninja's, cybersecurity, API's and web development, UI interface

-  Northrop Grumman internships (high school programs)

### How to find internships

- Show off projects.

- look for work experience.

- Show you know how to do work.

- Finding algorithms (search, sorting, graph theory, " " problem)

- Search around september of next year to mid november is when resume needs to be done. (Qualcomm)

- Engineering doesn't change throughout schools, stand out through projects and experience. 

- Small companies can take high school.

- USE YOUR RESOURCES, find people to refer you or get you internships.

- Talk to people that could help you.

- LinkedIns

- Apply for Code ninjas

### Use of CS in mechanical engineering

- Mirror components.

- Script that took and isolated extra text in being mirrored.

- Manipulating data. 

- Simulations for materials converted from hand to functions then setup for computations. 

### Clubs or programs

- UAV's 

- Personal use

### Why did you want to go into machine learning

- Had to look for a new major

- Technical classes 

- Art Ai's

### Clubs at DN related to CS

- Robotics

- SD stem startup's
