# Reflection of Tri 1 of CSA

## College Board exam 30/40

### Question 4 

Used double with float to evaluate the expression instead of an Int for rounding.
 
### Question 5

Improper iterization through code segments, initialized it from 0 instead of 1 so it was iterating by to 3, 6, etc instead of 4, 7

### Question 15

Didn't realize there was an array out of bounds exception for the 2nd answer

### Question 17 

Out of bounds exception at 7 stops value from continuing to 8 and repeats 7

### Question 19 

De Morgan's law flips the not and and on logic operators

### Question 20 

Contents of the array are reversed since it is decremented through the loop

### Question 23

Literally just clicked the wrong one lol

### Question 24 

Flipped the column and row major order, iterated throught the array sideways

### Question 33 

Misinterpretation as an && instead of || for proper results. Flip logic operators in boolean expression. 

### Question 35

Math done wrong, multiplication by result value leads to result

### Good

Overall I worked far harder this tri and communicated within my group well. We were able to conisistently call and help one another with issues we were having on both group and individual assignemnts. I found myself able to solve problems as an indivdual far better than last year and was able to help my teamates in addition to them helping me. I had a fair amount of commits and contributions to my team repository and was consistent in my commit frequency. 

### Bad

My biggest drawbacks for this tri was catching after I was sick, and understanding of some key concepts. My hardest unit was loops and iteration. I need to work on a deeper understanding of this topic as it is very important, however how the elements of certain loops interacted with paramters presented and methods was a challenge. My other challenge was catching up on work I missed, and I almost entirely gave up on catching up as I was still very focused on the current work at hand.
